    <h1>The Comedy of Code</h1>
    <p class="tagline">I interrogate code like a detective in a buddy‑cop movie. Assembly grumbles, C lectures, Python smirks — and I translate it all into truth at the instruction level.</p>

      <h2 id="motto">My motto</h2>
      <p class="motto">“Code is the script. Instructions are the actors. Reverse engineering is the blooper reel — and I’m here for the laughs.” 🎬💻</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="mindset">
      <h2 id="mindset">My mindset</h2>
      <p>I don’t just write code — I cross‑examine it. If a program says “Hello, world,” I want the backstory: who whispered the line, which register carried the message, and which opcode pulled the strings. I chase clarity with a smirk and precision with a magnifying glass. Under the humor is a serious goal: understand how human intent becomes machine behavior.</p>
      <p>Assembly is my truth serum, C is my discipline coach, Python is my charming accomplice. Reverse engineering is where the punchlines land — in disassembly windows, call stacks, and hex dumps — and where the machine finally confesses what it’s really doing.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <p><span class="label">Assembly:</span> The cryptic wizard mumbling incantations like <code>MOV AX, BX</code>. At first it’s gibberish; then it’s pure power. Every mnemonic maps to a real instruction — no fluff, just the truth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <p><span class="label">C:</span> The grumpy professor handing you pointers and telling you to behave. Memory is your midterm, undefined behavior is the pop quiz. Pass, and the machine respects you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <p><span class="label">Python:</span> The cool kid who automates the boring parts, ships a one‑liner, and casually says “done.” Under the hoodie: powerful runtimes, rich libraries, and perfect RE sidekicks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <p><span class="label">Reverse engineering:</span> The magnifying glass that reveals the deleted scenes: control flow, calling conventions, ABI quirks, and those suspicious jumps. It’s where intent meets opcode.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="principles">
      <h2 id="principles">What drives me</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> If it’s not defensible at the instruction level, it’s not done.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> I refine until even the CPU would nod in agreement.</li>
        <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> If there’s a rabbit hole, I’m already halfway down it.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Teach the craft so others can see through the Matrix with a grin.</li>
      </ul>

    <section aria-labelledby="signature">
      <h2 id="signature">Signature move</h2>
      <p>I turn source into stories and binaries into confessions. One minute it’s <code>printf("Hello, world!")</code>, the next it’s an instruction trace that ends with a syscall and a smirk. That’s the show I run — entertaining, exact, and unapologetically low‑level.</p>
      <pre><code>// What you see
printf("Hello, world!\n");

// What the machine sees (simplified journey)
mov rdi, OFFSET hello_string
call printf
; ...libc formatting, buffering, write() syscall...
      </code></pre>

    <h2>Start Your Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Begin with
      <a href="Day1.html">Day 1 – Types of Storage Devices</a> and follow the trail
      through disk geometry, boot code, partition tables, and forensic timelines.
      Each article is modular, so you can jump in anywhere—but the full journey
      is where the real transformation happens.
